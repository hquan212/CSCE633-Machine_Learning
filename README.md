This is the collection of homeworks from the CSCE 633 course taken in Fall 2017. The topics covered in this course are Linear Regression, Logistical Regression, Decision Trees, KNN Classification, Deep Neural Networks, SVM, and Markov Chains.

Here is a sample of my work for the class [PCA Example](https://github.com/hquan212/CSCE633-Machine_Learning/blob/master/Hw3/final-hw3.pdf).
